# GameJavaEdition
This project simulates the battle system for a game I invented as a very, very young kid. Meant to be accompanied with a physical board and two armies composed of small pieces acting as the units. 

I first coded the battle system using Java when I was in middle school in order to simulate a large number of battles between two units to determine if they were balanced. Over the last two months, I decided to flesh out the entire game (save for graphics) which eliminated the need for paper and dice to keep track of unit health, turns, etc. One day I might use JavaFX to add a game board. 

Known as 'JavaEdition' because the Python edition has sadly been lost ðŸ˜”
